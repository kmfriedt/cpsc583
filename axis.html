    <h1>Price and Range</h1>
    <p>The scatter chart is not my primary visualization.
        It is mainly there to allow the user to narrow down on which cars it would like to look at.
        The first variation is price versus range for each model.
        This chart was quite cramped so I did one with the cars grouped by brand as well.
        I plan to allow the users to change the price to one that they would be willing to pay for a vehicle.
        I also plan to allow them to change the range that they would want.
        I also need to generate a legend for the graph. </p>

    <script src="scatter.js"></script>
    <script>
        setupModel("scatter2", "price", "range", "Price (CDN$)", "Range (km)", "avgPrice", "avgTrip");
    </script>
    <button id="switchDots", onclick="switchDots()">Switch to Brand View</button>
    <input id="changePrice" type="text" onchange="changePrice()" value=33500>
    <input id="changeRange" type="text" onchange="changeRange()" value=160>



    <h1>4 Brands and 6 features</h1>
    <p>This radar chart was adapted from the work done by Nadieh Bremmer
        found at http://bl.ocks.org/nbremer/21746a9668ffdf6d8242.
        I had to adjust the code to work with version 6 and with m data.
        This variation looked at 4 vehicles and 6 key features of those vehicles.
        I would like to add more features to fill in the chart a little more. I also found that
        I need to order the blobs to make sure that you can highlight each of them with mouse over. </p>
