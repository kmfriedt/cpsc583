    <h1>Price and Range</h1>
    <p>The scatter chart is not my primary visualization.
        It is mainly there to allow the user to narrow down on which cars it would like to look at.
        The first variation is price versus range for each model.
        This chart was quite cramped so I did one with the cars grouped by brand as well.
        I plan to allow the users to change the price to one that they would be willing to pay for a vehicle.
        I also plan to allow them to change the range that they would want.
        I also need to generate a legend for the graph. </p>
    <svg id="scatter2" width="800" height="600" viewBox="0 0 800 600">
        <rect class="bg"></rect>
    </svg>
    <script src="scatter2.js"></script>
    <script>
        setupModel("scatter2", "price", "range", "Price (CDN$)", "Range (km)", "avgPrice","avgTrip");
    </script>

    <h1>Brand Price and Range</h1>
    <svg id="scatter3" width="800" height="600" viewBox="0 0 800 600">
        <rect class="bg"></rect>
    </svg>
    <script src="scatter2.js"></script>
    <script>
        setupBrand("scatter3", "price", "range", "Price (CDN$)", "Range (km)" , "avgPrice","avgTrip");
    </script>

<h1>Model Acceleration</h1>
    <p>This was just a test to see how to use a category at the bottom.
    I still have to figure out the axis at the bottom and the grid lines.
    Also there are some issues with the data fitting in the white box.</p>
    <svg id="scatter4" width="800" height="600" viewBox="0 0 800 600">
        <rect class="bg"></rect>
    </svg>
    <script src="scatter2.js"></script>
    <script>
        setupModel("scatter4", "model", "accel", "Model", "Acceleration 0-60 (s)", "none", "avgAcceleration" );
    </script>

<h1>Brand Acceleration</h1>
    <p> Just by brand as well</p>
<svg id="scatter5" width="800" height="600" viewBox="0 0 800 600">
    <rect class="bg"></rect>
</svg>
<script src="scatter2.js"></script>
<script>
    setupBrand("scatter5", "brand", "accel", "Brand", "Acceleration 0-60 (s)", "none", "avgAcceleration" );

    <h1>4 Brands and 6 features</h1>
    <p>This radar chart was adapted from the work done by Nadieh Bremmer
        found at http://bl.ocks.org/nbremer/21746a9668ffdf6d8242.
        I had to adjust the code to work with version 6 and with m data.
        This variation looked at 4 vehicles and 6 key features of those vehicles.
        I would like to add more features to fill in the chart a little more. I also found that
        I need to order the blobs to make sure that you can highlight each of them with mouse over. </p>

    <svg id="radar3" width="800" height="600" viewBox="0 0 800 600">
        <rect class="bg"></rect>
    </svg>
    <script src="radar3.js"></script>
    <script>
        setupRadar3("radar3");
    </script>

    <h1>Acceleration on the left and Range on the Right the dot color represents a brand.
    The blob color represents the feature being measured. Blue for Range, Orange for Acceleration.</h1>
    <p>This was an attempt to show information on each side of the central axis.
        This one shows the vehicles acceleration on the left and range on the right.
        I need to include a legend for this and data labels.
        I found this quite hard to implement, and I am still not happy with how it looks.
        The dividing axis needs to be rotated and I donâ€™t think the visual works well with blobs.
        I should do a line to each data point instead.
        I wanted to use a linear line for the blobs but it cut through some of the data points.
        I need to find a better alternative. </p>
    <svg id="radar4" width="800" height="600" viewBox="0 0 800 600">
        <rect class="bg"></rect>

    <script src="radar3.js"></script>
    <script>
        setupRadar4("radar4");
    </script>

    <h1>Acceleration on the Left Range on the Right, The blob color represents a car</h1>
    <p>This was another attempt to show the information based on two features in the same radar chart.
        This time I just used a blob for each half to show the information for a vehicle.
        I tried this to see how it would look and to see if I could order the data
        to allow you to highlight each blob on mouse over.
        I did this for the left blob but not for the right so I could see the difference. </p>

    <script>
        setupRadar5("radar5");
